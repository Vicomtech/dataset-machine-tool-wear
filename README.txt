This dataset contains the data captured in a machine tool process (turning) that includs data from the control system, sensors and tool flank wear.
Data corresponding to 13 diferent tools was acquired and segmented into N segments of 1 s. The total number of considered segments is equal to the number of rows in the dataset, i.e. 2054.	
Different features were extracted from each of the segments and the flank wear, i.e. Vb, of each tool was calculated.

For each signal, the following five values were extracted:	
Feature	Description
MEAN	The sum of a group of numbers divided by the amount of numbers of that collection
RMS	The square root of the mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of numbers)
MAX	The maximum value of a group of numbers
SK	Skewness is a measure of symmetry in a distribution
KURT	Kurtosis is a measure of the “tailedness” of the probability distribution of a variable
	
Regarding the acoustic emission signal, however, the following features were extracted:	
RMS	The square root of the mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of numbers)
MAX	The maximum value of a group of numbers
KURT	Kurtosis is a measure of the “tailedness” of the probability distribution of a variable
VAR	Variance is the sum of squared differences from the mean divided by number of elements
C_0.1	Number of times that the amplitude of the signal exceeds a predefined threshold - 0.1 V
C_0.15	Number of times that the amplitude of the signal exceeds a predefined threshold - 0.15 V
CF	Crest Factor is the peak amplitude of the waveform divided by the RMS value of the waveform
